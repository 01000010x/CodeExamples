WorldFacts

Version 1.0 6 June 2012     Initial Version
=======================================================================

The WorldFacts App demonstrates how to use Storyboards to create a 
dynamic table view cell using a prototype cell. This is a big
improvement over iOS 4 where it was necessary to design the cell
in a separate NIB and then manually load it and instantiate each
cell.

The geographic data used in this App is from GeoNames and used under

=======================================================================
Model
=======================================================================

WorldFacts.xcdatamodeld

The core data model definition contains a single entity for the Country
managed object.

Country.h
Country.m

The generated NSManagedObject subclass

Country+Extensions.h
Country+Extensions.m

Private class extensions for the Country NSManagedObject subclass to
generate the section title used by the NSFetchedResultsController and
to import an initial set of geographic data from countries.plist.

=======================================================================
View
=======================================================================

Country.storyboard
The storyboard file used to create the table view and custom prototype
cell.

UYLCountryTableViewController.xib
Traditional NIB file used to load the country table view when not using
a storyboard. This NIB file is not used in the final version of the App
but is included for reference.  If you want to revert back to
using this NIB you will need to add it to the target.

CountryCell.xib
Traditional NIB file used to create the custom table view cell when not
using a storyboard. This NIB file is not used in the final version of
the App but is included for reference. If you want to revert back to
using this NIB you will need to add it to the target.

=======================================================================
Controllers
=======================================================================

UYLCountryTableViewController.h
UYLCountryTableViewController.m

The table view controller used to show the list of countries with
details on the capital and population in a custom cell layout. The 
table view controller implementation is a standard implementation of
an NSFetchResultsController.

The key code showing how the cell NIB is loaded is contained in the
method -tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:.

=======================================================================
App Delegate
=======================================================================

UYLAppDelegate.h
UYLAppDelegate.m

The App delegate is largely unmodified from the template code. It creates
the root view controller using a storyboard and initialises the core data
stack.
