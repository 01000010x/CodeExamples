Huckleberry - Auto layout table view cells with varying row heights
Version 1.0   14 February 2014   Initial version.
=======================================================================

Example of how to implement table view cells with varying row heights
using auto layout constraints and a dummy prototype cell.

The source data for the table view is taken from the first 15 chapters
of Huckleberry Finn as found on Project Gutenberg. This gives nearly
2000 rows of data.
